incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

Clarifai (clarifai-apple-sdk)

CLARIFAI SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT

This Clarifai Software License Agreement (this “Agreement”) is between You or the entity or company that You represent ("You", “Your” or “Licensee”) and Clarifai, Inc. ("Clarifai") regarding Your use of the software development kit and any associated documentation, software code or other materials made available by Clarifai (collectively, the "SDK"). This Agreement also applies to documentation for Clarifai’s application programming interfaces (collectively the "APIs"), which are further defined separately by Clarifai’s Terms of Service available at https://developer.clarifai.com/extras/api-terms/ ("TOS"), and any software code provided by Clarifai in conjunction with such documentation. The SDK is made available by Clarifai to assist developers in integrating certain functionality of the Clarifai internet-based services (the "Clarifai Services") into applications, such as web or mobile applications. This Agreement applies to any SDK that includes, displays or links to this Agreement, and to any updates, supplements or support services for such SDK, unless stated otherwise.

BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SDK, YOU UNCONDITIONALLY ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN COMPUTER INFORMATION DURING USE OF THE SDK, AND ARE HEREBY REPRESENTING AND WARRANTING THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO BIND LICENSEE. IF YOU DO NOT UNCONDITIONALLY AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE SDK OR THE APIs.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE. Subject to Your compliance with this Agreement, You may install and use any number of copies of the SDK on Your devices to design, develop and test Authorized Applications (defined below) as further set forth herein. Each copy of the SDK must be complete, including all copyright and trademark notices. You must require end users of the Authorized Applications to agree to terms of use at least as protective of the SDK as this Agreement.  You shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce each sublicense agreement and shall notify Clarifai of any breach of a material obligation under any agreement, and shall cooperate with Clarifai in any legal action to prevent or stop unauthorized use, reproduction or distribution of an Authorized Application.

2. AUTHORIZED APPLICATIONS. Subject to Your compliance with this Agreement, You may use the SDK solely for the purpose of creating "Authorized Applications", which are applications, such as (a) web or mobile applications, in object code form, or (b) those portions of Your gateway server ("server interfaces") that are designed to provide access to the Clarifai Services, and that (i) You make available for download (e.g., via Your website or an application store), (ii) You make accessible through Your web interface or service, or (iii) You pre-install and embed on Your device(s). You are not authorized to pre-install or embed applications created using this SDK on third-party devices. You may not charge end users of the Authorized Applications any fee to access or use the Clarifai Services from within Your Authorized Applications. You may not rent, lease or lend any of Your rights in the SDK or access to the Clarifai Services. You may reproduce the SDK, provided that You reproduce only complete copies, including without limitation all "README" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that Clarifai has included in the SDK. You may not distribute any copy You make of the SDK. Each Authorized Application must be 100% compatible with the APIs and the SDK (including changes provided to you by Clarifai, which shall be implemented in the Authorized Application promptly thereafter).  If any Authorized Application uses or implements an outdated version of the APIs or the SDK, You acknowledge and agree that such Authorized Application may not be able to communicate with the Clarifai Services.  You agree not to modify, extend, subset or superset the APIs to any extent. You understand that Clarifai may cease support of old versions or releases of the APIs or the SDK.  You agree that the form, function and nature of the SDK that Clarifai provides may change without prior notice and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Clarifai may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to You or to users generally at Clarifai’s sole discretion, without prior notice.

3. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. Unless otherwise provided, if the SDK contains other Clarifai programs, the terms of this Agreement apply to Your use of those programs. The SDK contains code that You are permitted to include in Authorized Applications if You comply with the terms below.

a. Right to Use and Distribute. You may modify, copy, and distribute the source code form of code marked as "sample" in the SDK ("Distributable Code"). You may permit distributors of Your Authorized Applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those applications.

b. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code that You distribute, You must:

1. require distributors and external end users to agree to terms at least as protective of the Distributable Code as this Agreement; and
2. indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Clarifai from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of Your Authorized Applications.

c. Distribution Restrictions. You may not:

1. alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;
2. use Clarifai’s trademarks in Your applications’ names or in a way that suggests Your applications come from or are endorsed by Clarifai;
3. include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful applications; or
4. modify, distribute or convey any Distributable Code so that the Distributable Code or any application to which it links, or of which it is a part, becomes subject to an Excluded License. An “Excluded License” is one that requires, as a condition of license, use, modification, distribution or conveyance that:
a) the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form;
b) others have the right to modify or create derivative works of it; and/or
c) it becomes redistributable at no charge.

4. PREVIEWS. The following additional terms apply to any SDK offered as part of Clarifai’s Private Preview.

a. Private Previews. Clarifai may invite You to try new products or services that are not generally available to the public (“Private Preview”). You may accept or decline any such Private Preview in Your sole discretion. Any Private Preview will be designated as “alpha,” “private beta,” “limited preview,” “public beta,” “pilot,” “limited release,” “developer preview,” “non-production” or other pertinent description. A Private Preview (1) is provided for evaluation purposes only and not for production use, (2) is not supported, (3) may contain bugs or errors, (4) may be subject to additional terms, which shall be provided to You if You are invited to a Private Preview, and (5) is subject to confidentiality as provided in Section 20 (for the avoidance of doubt, this includes a prohibition on posting comments or other information about the Private Preview in any public forum such as GitHub, Reddit, etc.). Clarifai may discontinue any Private Preview at any time in its sole discretion. Clarifai owns all right, title and interest in and to all Private Previews and any feedback or evaluations You provide in connection with such Private Previews. IF YOU DECIDE TO MAKE USE OF ANY OF THE RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT YOU AGREE THAT IT IS AT YOUR SOLE DISCRETION AND YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND RISK OF ANY AND ALL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SDK, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE UNAVAILABILITY OR INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS OR THE LOSS OF ANY DATA OR OTHER CONTENT.

b. Development and Testing Use. If You comply with the rest of these Agreement terms, You may use the SDK to design, develop and test Authorized Applications. You may not distribute the Authorized Application or any Distributable Code in a live production environment unless expressly permitted by Clarifai and solely in distribution channels as authorized by Clarifai.

c. No Support Services. Clarifai does not provide any technical or other support ("Support Services") for Private Previews; provided, however, that if Clarifai chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use of such Support Services will be governed by the terms Clarifai provides to You in connection with such Support Services.

5. CLARIFAI SERVICES. Clarifai may change or cancel the Clarifai Services at any time. You may not use this SDK or the Clarifai Services in any way that could harm the Clarifai Services or impair anyone else’s use of the Clarifai Services. You may not use the SDK or the Clarifai Services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means. Some SDK features connect to Clarifai computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, You will not receive a separate notice when they connect. By using this SDK, You consent to the transmission of this information.

6. SCOPE OF LICENSES. The SDK is licensed, not sold. This Agreement only gives You some rights to use the SDK. Clarifai reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives You more rights despite this limitation, You may use the SDK only as expressly permitted in this Agreement. In doing so, You must comply with any technical limitations in the SDK that only allow You to use it in certain ways. You may not:

a. work around any technical limitations in the SDK;
b. reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the SDK, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
c. make more copies of the SDK than specified in this Agreement or allowed by, except and only to the extent applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation; or
d. publish the SDK for others to copy.

You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are expressly permitted by (i) this Agreement and (ii) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in relevant jurisdictions. You agree not to assert any patent rights related to the SDK or any Authorized Applications against Clarifai, its distributors, customers, or other licensees of the SDK for making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing any products or technology developed using the SDK.

7. USE OF THE SERVICES. Your use of the Clarifai Services, and the use of the Clarifai Services by anyone hosting or using Your Authorized Application, is governed by the then-current TOS which can be found on https://developer.clarifai.com/extras/api-terms/. If any SDK for which You are granted rights hereunder makes use of the Clarifai Services (as governed by the applicable TOS), then those SDK rights are granted subject to Your compliance with the applicable TOS.

8. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL UNITED STATES, AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.  YOU ASSUME SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FOR OBTAINING REQUIRED EXPORT AND IMPORT AUTHORIZATIONS.  CLARIFAI MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT IF YOU ARE IN VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS.  YOU AGREE THAT CLARIFAI MAY AUDIT YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

9. FEES. Clarifai’s current pricing is located at https://developer.clarifai.com/pricing/. Clarifai may change its pricing and payment terms at any time, and You agree to pay the fees specified therein. If Clarifai, in its sole discretion, chooses to change its pricing and payment terms, Clarifai will provide notice of such changes as provided in Section 12 below. You will stop using the SDK, APIs and/or Clarifai Services if You do not accept Clarifai’s changes to pricing and payment terms.

10. TERMINATION. Clarifai reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK, APIs and Clarifai Services or to modify the SDK, APIs or Clarifai Services at any time in its sole discretion. If You are dissatisfied with any aspect of the SDK, APIs or Clarifai Services at any time, Your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using them. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Clarifai may also, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the SDK, APIs and Clarifai Services to You or any end user at any time. You acknowledge that termination and/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if You breach this Agreement and that Clarifai will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach. This Section and Sections 11 (Reservation of Rights), 13 (Entire Agreement), 14 (Applicable Law), 17 (Disclaimer of Warranty), 18 (Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages), 19 (Indemnification) and 20 (Confidentiality) will survive termination of this Agreement or any discontinuation of the offering of the SDK, APIs or Clarifai Services, along with any other provisions that would reasonably be deemed to survive such events.

11. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Except for the licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, Clarifai and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest in and to the SDK, APIs, Clarifai Services, and all intellectual property rights therein. You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, format, create derivative works of or otherwise use any materials, content or technology provided under this Agreement except as explicitly provided in this Agreement or approved in advance in writing by Clarifai.

12. MODIFICATIONS; NOTICES. If Clarifai changes this Agreement, Clarifai will give You notice before such change goes into effect. If You do not agree to such changes, then You must immediately stop using the SDK, Clarifai Services and APIs before such changes go into effect. If You do not stop using the SDK, Clarifai Services or APIs, then Your use of the SDK, Clarifai Services or APIs will be governed by the terms of, including any changes to, this Agreement. Clarifai may give notices to You, at Clarifai’s option, by posting on any portion of www.clarifai.com or by electronic mail to any e-mail address provided by You to Clarifai.

13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement and the TOS constitute the entire understanding between You and Clarifai with respect to the SDK, the Clarifai Services and the APIs, and supersede any arrangements, understandings, promises or agreements made or existing between You and Clarifai prior to or simultaneously with this Agreement and the TOS. The rights granted in this Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by You, in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of Clarifai. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the parties.

14. APPLICABLE LAW; VENUE. This Agreement is governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, USA without reference to conflicts of law principles. You agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded in its entirety from application to this Agreement. The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement will be the state or federal courts located in New York, New York and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such action.

15. LEGAL EFFECT. This Agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of Your country. This Agreement does not change Your rights under the laws of Your country if the laws of Your country do not permit it to do so.

16. SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement.

17. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SDK, THE CLARIFAI SERVICES AND THE APIS ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND CLARIFAI HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS SO THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

18. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL CLARIFAI OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE API, THE SDK, THE CLARIFAI SERVICES, CONTENT (INCLUDING CODE) ON THIRD-PARTY INTERNET SITES OR THIRD-PARTY PROGRAMS. CLARIFAI’S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO $5.00. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF YOU OR CLARIFAI HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

19. INDEMNIFICATION. You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Clarifai and each of its employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), that arise from or relate to (a) You or Your end users’ use or misuse of, or access to, the SDK, the Clarifai Services and the APIs, (b) your violation of this Agreement, (c) infringement by You, or any third party using Your account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or (d) a claim alleging that any of Your data infringes the rights of, or has caused harm to, a third party. Clarifai reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You, in which event You shall assist and cooperate with Clarifai in asserting any available defenses.

20. CONFIDENTIALITY. You shall take all reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of the SDK and other Clarifai technical information obtained by You (“Confidential Information”), and will not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except as expressly authorized in this Agreement.  You shall at all times, both during the term of this Agreement and thereafter until the Confidential Information falls into one of the exceptions below, keep in trust and confidence all such Confidential Information, and shall not use such Confidential Information other than as expressly authorized by Clarifai under this Agreement, nor shall You disclose any such Confidential Information to third parties without Clarifai’s written consent.  You shall similarly bind Your employees, consultants and independent contractors to the confidentiality obligations in this Agreement, and shall be responsible for any breaches thereof.  You further agrees to return to Clarifai all Confidential Information (including copies thereof) in Your possession, custody or control upon termination of this Agreement at any time and for any reason.  The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information which (i) has entered the public domain except where such entry is in result of Your breach of this Agreement; (ii) prior to disclosure hereunder was already rightfully in Your possession; (iii) subsequent to disclosure hereunder is obtained by You on a non-confidential basis from a third party who has the right to disclose such information to the You; or (iv) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a court order, so long as Clarifai is given adequate notice and the ability to challenge such required disclosure.
